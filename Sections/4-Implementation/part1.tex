% 1: first we need to translate the Hermes instances to RSSA
% 2: show some of the translation rules from Hermes to RIL. Also talk about the strings that are generated (inits, finits).
% 3: show some of the translation rules from RIL to RSSA. Talk about the nontrivial parts (environment, lookup function). Maybe mention invertStat and how we reverse the process. 
% 4: show some of the translation rules from RSSA to ARM.
%       Interesting:  * abstract register names and registerallocator
%                     * side-channels and times / div
%                     * modulo implementation (hopefully not using div/mul/sub)
%                     * dynamic allocation and heap register x28 I've made up - show symtab and how everything works
%                     * static array allocation
%                     * call/uncall using store and load operations as well as stack frames.
