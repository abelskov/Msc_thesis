\section{Outline}
This Master thesis is organized in the following way:
\begin{description}
  \item [Chapter 2] leads off with an introduction to reversibility, side-channel vulnerabilities, RSSA and the ARM architecture.
  \item [Chapter 3] then analyzes how to compile from Hermes to ARM whilst mitigating side-channels and goes over the parts of ARM we need for the translation.
  \item [Chapter 4] covers the actual compilation i.e. what steps are taken and how does the program change from source code to intermediate representation to assembly code.
  \item [Chapter 5] concerns the symmetric encryption algorithm Twofish and a reversible implementation of it written in Hermes.
  \item [Chapter 6] shows some experiments run regarding the reversible Twofish implementation and the Hermes to ARM compiler.
  \item [Chapter 7] is a discussion of results.
  \item [Chapter 8] is a conclusion and ideas for future work.
\end{description}
The full implementation of both the RSSA- and ARM-compiler is around 1500 lines of code, which have been handed in seperately.
The reversible implementation of Twofish written in Hermes can be found in Appendix~\ref{appendix:A}.
