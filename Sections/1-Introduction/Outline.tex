\section{Outline}
This Master thesis is organized in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Chapter 2} leads off with an introduction to reversibility, side-channel vulnerabilities, the ARM architecture and RSSA.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 3} then analyzes how to compile from Hermes to ARM whilst mitigating side-channels and goes over the parts of ARM we need for the translation.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 4} covers the actual compilation i.e. what steps are taken and how does the program change from source code to intermediate representation to assembly code.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 5} concerns the symmetric encryption algorithm Twofish and my Hermes implementation of it.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 6} is about benchmarks and testing.
  \item \textbf{Chapter 7} is a discussion of the results
  \item In \textbf{Chapter 8} I present my conclusions and ideas for future work.
\end{itemize}
In the appendix I have provided the full implementation of both the ARM compiler and the Twofish implementation in Hermes.
