\section{Outline}
This thesis is organized as follows: section 2 introduces reversibility, side-channel vulnerabilities, the ARM architecture and RSSA. Section 3 analyzes how to compile from Hermes to ARM mitigating side-channels and goes over the parts of ARM we need for the translation. Section 4 covers the compilation. Section 5 concerns the symmetric encryption algorithm Twofish: what it is and my Hermes implementation. Section 6 is about benchmarks and testing. Section 7 is a discussion of the results and finally in Section 8 I present my conclusions and ideas for future work.
