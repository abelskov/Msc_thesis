\section{Outline}
TODO: Maybe put RIL/RSSA explanation in section 2
This thesis is organized as follows: section 2 introduces side-channel vulnerabilities. Section 3 describes the concept of reversible programming. Section 4 describes RSSA and the first part of compilation: Hermes to RSSA. Section 5 describes ARM64 and the second part of compilation: RSSA to ARM64. Section 6 talks about the Twofish algorithm and my implementation in Hermes. Section 7 is about benchmarks and testing. Finally in Section 8 I present my conclusions and ideas for future work.
