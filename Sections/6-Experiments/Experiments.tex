In this chapter we will present the experiments that have been run to test the different implementations.
The experiments have been run on a laptop with an Intel 3rd Gen Core graphics card and four CPU cores \lstinline{Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3230M CPU @ 2.60GHz}.

First we will look at correctness of the ARM implementation.
Hermes has a script named \emph{test.sh}, as shown in Listing~\ref{listing:unit_tests}, that serves as a unit test. It runs through the \emph{code/ril/} directory, compiling every file and performing a ``diff`` with an expected output.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=listing:unit_tests, caption=Unit testing of the compiler is performed by a bash script., language=bash, float=htp]
CODEDIR="code/ril/"
TEST="code/ril/lol"
./hermes/hermes_formal_typesystem/bin/hc --arm ${TEST}

DIFF=$(diff code/ril/lol.asm unit_tests/expected.asm)
if [ -z "$DIFF" ]; then
  echo "Tests completed succesfully"
else
  echo "Error in tests"
fi
\end{lstlisting}
This results in the following when run:
\begin{lstlisting}[float=htp]
Tests completed succesfully
\end{lstlisting} \\
Furthermore, there are two reference solutions to Twofish written in Python and C that we will run against our solution.
Listing~\ref{listing:python_experiment} is a comparison with the Python version when encrypting/decrypting 50 times.
Listing~\ref{listing:python_experiment_result} shows the result. It contains print statements of the original data, the encrypted data and the decrypted data, which is equal to the original data.
Listing~\ref{listing:bench_C} is a comparison with the highly optimized C version when encrypting 50 times.
Listing~\ref{listing:bench_C_results} shows the result. We see that the optimized C is approximately 63, times faster as $24.610950 / 0.389056 \simeq 63$.
